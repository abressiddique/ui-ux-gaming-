**Awwwards Website** is a visually striking and interactive website designed with a focus on **gaming elements** and **unique UI/UX**. It was created for a college competition where the most unique design would win the first award, and Iâ€™m proud to say that I won!

The website incorporates various creative and engaging gaming-inspired design elements that give it a dynamic and playful look while maintaining usability and a smooth user experience. It features smooth animations, interactive sections, and a modern design approach that sets it apart from traditional websites.

The project is built using **React**, **GSAP animations**, and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a responsive, smooth, and visually captivating experience for users.
